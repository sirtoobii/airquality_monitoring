### Air quality monitoring
This projects aims to create an air quality monitoring setup with inexpensive components. Initially
setup with an Arduino nano but later ported to a Raspberry PI.

The data is collected using the following sensors:  
- BMP180 (Air pressure, Temperature)
- MH-Z19B (Co2 concentration)
- SMT20 (Humidity, Temperature)
To interface with the sensors, either an Arduino or Raspberry PI computer can be used

| `pi`         | This project implemented on a Raspberry PI                                                                               |                                                                                                                                |
| `python`     | Python files: Write data values to the influx db (`data_logger.py`) and   scan for new advertisement packets (`scanner.py`) |  There is `requirements.txt` file present, which use to   install all required packages: ```pip install -i requirements.txt``` |

### Technology Stack
- Data is stored in a Influx-DB
- A Grafana-Dashboard is used to display the measured values
- Scripting language at the receiver-side is Python `3.6`
- (Arduino) The data is transmitted using iBeacon `UUID-String` (yes this is a hack see more info below)


### Data transmission (Arduino)
As mentioned above the collected data is transmitted using Bluetooth Low Energy to
the receiver. Generally speaking, the data is transmitted using the advertisement
data:
```
Index         :        7   11 13   15     19 21   23 25                  39
                       |    |  |    |      |  |    |  |                   |
Example string: 4c000215 0190 1b   27   03c9 27   a0 a0   0000000 000000 2d       ffe0ffe1 c5
Labels        : Ibeacon  co2  temp.temp pres.pres hum.hum ------- ------ checksum other_stuff
```
However, since the HM-10 does not support changing the advertisement data
directly, I had to _abuse_ the iBeacon mode where you can change 32 Bytes of the `UUID-String`. To make things worse (more interesting!), the BLE-Module only allows you to
change 8 Bytes of the `UUID-String` at once. For example the `AT` command for the first 8 Bytes:
```
AT+IBE0AABBCCDD # As a side-note: all Hex-Characters have to be upper-case
```
And you guessed it, you can't control **when** an advertisement package is sent.
This the reason the checksum is needed :)

### Future work, remarks and problems
- Currently only one temperature value is evaluated. However, all sensors measure
temperature, therefore we could compare them and even create some sort of a _confidence-interval_
- If you power on the whole circuit, the first _valid_ (according to the checksum) transmitted value of the co2-sensor is sometimes way off (in the 5-6k area)
- Don't buy the components on aliexpres or similar. I've wasted (too) many hours figuring out that for example the HM-10 Module was a clone of a _clone_ of the original.
- Feedback, ideas and PR's welcome :)
